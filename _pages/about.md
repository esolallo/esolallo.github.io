I'm a third year PhD student at the UCLA linguistics department.

My research focuses on morphology and its interfaces with phonology and syntax. I am particularly interested in infant acquisition of morphological alternations, how it does or does not differ from the acquisition of phonotactic dependencies, and how the learning of one kind of process may impact the learning of the other.

I also do fieldwork on San Crist√≥bal Lachirioag Zapotec, a Northern Zapotec language from the Villa Alta district of Oaxaca, Mexico.
