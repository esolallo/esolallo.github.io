I'm a sixth year PhD student at the UCLA linguistics department. My research focuses primarily on the acquisition of phonetic and phonological processes. I am particularly interested in using experimental methods to investigate how people learn, both by looking at initial perceptual biases that impact early acquisition and the learning strategies that children use to figure out how to speak like an adult. 

In my dissertation, I am comparing 4-8 year old children and adults' productions of Mandarin rising (T2) and falling (T4) tones as a case study into how children develop adult-like phonetic grammars.

I also do fieldwork on San Crist√≥bal Lachirioag Zapotec, a Northern Zapotec language from the Villa Alta district of Oaxaca, Mexico.
